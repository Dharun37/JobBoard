## What We've Implemented

âœ… **Complete job application system** with database support
âœ… **JobApplication model** with status tracking
âœ… **Application counting** for job posts
âœ… **Cover letter support** (optional)
âœ… **Duplicate application prevention**
âœ… **Success notifications** after applying
âœ… **Proper error handling** and user guidance

## How to Test the Job Application Feature

### 1. First Time Setup (Required)
The error you encountered happens because users must complete their **job seeker profile** before applying to jobs.

**To fix this:**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/onboarding`
2. Select **"Job Seeker"** as your user type
3. Fill out the onboarding form:
   - Full Name
   - Short Bio
   - Resume (PDF upload)
4. Click **"Complete Profile"**

### 2. Apply to Jobs
Once your job seeker profile is complete:
1. Go to any job posting page (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/job/[jobId]`)
2. Scroll down to the **"Apply now"** card in the sidebar
3. Optionally add a cover letter (max 1000 characters)
4. Click **"Apply now"**
5. You'll see a success message and be redirected back to the job page

### 3. Application States
The system shows different states:

**Before Applying:**
- Shows "Apply now" form with cover letter option

**After Applying:**
- Shows "Application Submitted" status
- Displays application date
- Shows current status (PENDING, REVIEWED, ACCEPTED, REJECTED)
- Prevents duplicate applications

**Not Logged In:**
- Shows "Login to Apply" button

## Database Structure

### JobApplication Model
```prisma
model JobApplication {
  id          String @id @default(uuid())
  jobId       String
  userId      String
  status      ApplicationStatus @default(PENDING)
  coverLetter String?
  appliedAt   DateTime @default(now())
  
  job  JobPost @relation(fields: [jobId], references: [id])
  user User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  
  @@unique([userId, jobId]) // Prevents duplicate applications
}

enum ApplicationStatus {
  PENDING
  REVIEWED
  ACCEPTED
  REJECTED
}
```

### Updated JobPost Model
- Added `applications` field to count total applications
- Auto-increments when someone applies

## Error Handling

The system handles these scenarios:
- **User not logged in** â†’ Redirects to login
- **Profile incomplete** â†’ Redirects to onboarding
- **Company users** â†’ Shows error (only job seekers can apply)
- **Duplicate applications** â†’ Shows "already applied" message
- **Server errors** â†’ Shows generic error message

## Features Included

1. **Cover Letter Support** - Optional text area with 1000 character limit
2. **Application Tracking** - Shows when user applied and current status
3. **Application Counter** - Job posts show total number of applications
4. **Success Feedback** - Green notification after successful application
5. **Duplicate Prevention** - Can't apply to the same job twice
6. **User Type Validation** - Only job seekers can apply

## Next Steps

Your job application system is now fully functional! Users can:
1. Complete onboarding as job seekers
2. Apply to jobs with optional cover letters
3. See their application status
4. Receive proper feedback

The system is ready for production use with proper error handling and user experience flows.
