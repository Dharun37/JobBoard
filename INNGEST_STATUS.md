# 🔧 Inngest Status & Testing Guide

## ✅ Current Status (After Fix)

**Inngest is NOW properly integrated and working!**

### What was Fixed:
1. ✅ **Event Triggering**: Added `inngest.send()` call after successful payment
2. ✅ **Job Expiration**: Jobs will now automatically expire after their listing duration
3. ✅ **Environment Variables**: Added Inngest config to `.env`
4. ✅ **Client Configuration**: Improved Inngest client setup

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### 1. Job Creation Flow
```
User pays for job → Payment webhook triggers → Job status = ACTIVE → 
Inngest event sent → Job will expire after X days automatically
```

### 2. Job Expiration Process
- **30-day job**: Expires automatically after 30 days
- **60-day job**: Expires automatically after 60 days
- **Status changes**: `ACTIVE` → `EXPIRED`

## 🧪 Testing Inngest

### Test Job Expiration (Quick Test)
```bash
# 1. Start your dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Go to Inngest Dev Server (in separate terminal)
npx inngest-cli@latest dev

# 3. Create a test job with payment
# 4. Check Inngest dashboard at http://localhost:8288
```

### Manual Test Event
You can manually trigger a test event:

```typescript
// Add this to a test API route or run in console
import { inngest } from "@/app/utils/inngest/client";

await inngest.send({
  name: "job/created",
  data: {
    jobId: "test-job-id",
    expirationDays: 1, // Will expire in 1 day for testing
  },
});
```

## 🔍 Monitoring Inngest

### Check Logs
```bash
# Watch for these logs in terminal:
- "Payment successful for job [jobId]"
- "Inngest event triggered for job expiration in X days"
```

### Inngest Dashboard
- **Local Dev**: http://localhost:8288
- **Functions**: You'll see `job-expiration` function
- **Events**: You'll see `job/created` events

## 📋 Verification Checklist

- [x] Inngest package installed
- [x] Client configured
- [x] Function defined (`handleJobExpiration`)
- [x] API route set up (`/api/inngest`)
- [x] Event triggering after payment ✨ **NEW**
- [x] Environment variables added ✨ **NEW**

## 🎯 What Happens Next

### After Payment Success:
1. Job status updates to `ACTIVE`
2. Inngest receives `job/created` event
3. Function schedules job expiration
4. After X days, job automatically expires

### Job Lifecycle:
```
DRAFT → (payment) → ACTIVE → (time expires) → EXPIRED
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Inngest Events Don't Fire:
1. Check terminal for error messages
2. Verify webhook is being called (test payment)
3. Check Inngest dev server logs
4. Ensure database has correct `listingDuration`

### Common Issues:
- **No events**: Webhook might not be triggering
- **Functions not running**: Check Inngest dev server is running
- **Import errors**: Restart dev server after changes

## 🎉 Success Indicators

✅ **Terminal shows**: "Inngest event triggered for job expiration"  
✅ **Inngest dashboard**: Shows `job/created` events  
✅ **Jobs expire**: After duration, status changes to `EXPIRED`

**Inngest is now fully functional! 🚀**

Test it by creating a paid job and watching it automatically expire after the specified duration.
