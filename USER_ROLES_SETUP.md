# Job Board User Roles & Dashboard System üéØ

## What I've Implemented

### 1. **Role-Based Navigation** 
‚úÖ **Different navbar for different user types**:
- **Companies (HR)**: Post Job, Applications, My Jobs
- **Job Seekers**: Favorites, My Applications
- **Guest Users**: Post Job, Login

### 2. **Company Dashboard Features**
‚úÖ **Job Applications Page** (`/job-applications`):
- View all applications across company's job postings
- See applicant details, resumes, cover letters
- Application status tracking (PENDING, REVIEWED, ACCEPTED, REJECTED)
- Download resumes directly
- Filter by job posting

### 3. **Job Seeker Dashboard Features**
‚úÖ **My Applications Page** (`/my-applications`):
- Track all job applications with status
- View application history
- See cover letters submitted
- Quick access to original job postings

### 4. **Smart Job Detail Pages**
‚úÖ **Different content based on user type**:

- **Job Seekers**: See apply form with cover letter option
- **Proper validation**: Only job seekers can apply

## How to Fix Your Current Issue

### **Step 1: Fix Your User Type**
Your error happens because your user profile isn't set up correctly. Choose one:

**Option A - Reset & Redo Onboarding:**

4. Complete the profile

**Option B - Direct Fix:**
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/api/debug/fix-user-type`

### **Step 2: Test the Features**

**As a Job Seeker:**
1. Apply to jobs with cover letters
2. Check `/my-applications` to see your applications
3. Navigate using "Favorites" and "My Applications" in the navbar

**As a Company (HR):**
